# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
My program draws a house by first drawing a rectangle as the outline of the main house, then draws a triangle on top of the rectangle as the roof, then draws a door and a knob at the bottom of the main house. The size and color are inputed by the user, and the program returns the size, stores it in a variable, and uses that size to draw a "sun" which is a circle.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
Nope
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
I asked a TA to help me with returning the size of the house. I also asked my brother some quesitons about syntax.
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
