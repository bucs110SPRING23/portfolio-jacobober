The Republican chairmen of the House Judiciary, Oversight, and Administration committees issued a letter to Manhattan District 
Attorney Alvin Bragg on Monday demanding testimony and documents related to the investigation and potential indictment of former 
President Donald Trump.
The joint letter, from House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, and House 
Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, is the first action by Republican House committees in response to Trump 
saying he expects to be indicted this week and after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy quickly announced he planned to use 
committees to probe the potential indictment and whether federal funding was involved.
Jordan also told ABC News on Monday that he doesn't believe Trump broke the law and called the expected indictment 
unprecedented in nature. When pressed on whether Jordan had any evidence to believe that federal funds were used in a local 
investigation, he said he did not and that's why they're looking into it.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said during a press conference on Sunday evening at the House Republicans' retreat in Orlando 
that he doesn't think people should protest in relation to any potential impending indictment of Trump.

"I don't think people should protest, no," McCarthy said when asked if he condones Trump's call to protest in relation to it 
made over Truth Social.
